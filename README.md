A Puzzle 3D Game developed with Unity 3D

Our Team designed a visual illusion puzzle game using Unity3d. 
'2.5' investigates the illusory effects between three-dimensional space and parallel projection. 
The player interacts with collapsed three-di- mensional information in order to create topo- logical solutions in a flattened view.
